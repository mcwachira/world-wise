## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- leaflet and react leaflet for maps


### What I learned

1. I learnt how to use React Context   to manage state in my app
2. Learnt how to use leaflet to render a map in the app
3. Learnt how to create a netlify function  to travel data in a json file
4. Learnt how to improve performance through code splitting and lazy loading.




### Continued development

The goal in future is 
1. Use firebase auth to handle authentication for users
2. Use firebase realtime database to store travel data
 
### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://www.react.com) - This helped me to understand hooks and the useReducer Hook.I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
