## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- leaflet and react leaflet for maps


### What I learned

1. I learned how to use React Context   to manage the state of my app
2. Learnt how to use leaflet library to render a map in the app
3. Learnt how to create a Netlify function  to travel data in a JSON file
4. Learned how to improve performance through code splitting and lazy loading.




### Continued development

The goal in the future is 
1. Use Firebase auth to handle authentication for users
2. Use Firebase real-time database to store travel data
 
### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://www.react.com) - This helped me to understand how to use the context API to manage the global state.
